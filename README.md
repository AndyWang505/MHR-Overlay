# monster-hunter-rise

Slightly modified Monster Hp Bar Mod https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/43?tab=description

But with few differences:

1) Shows health bars for all large monsters;
2) Changed layout, appearance and added text shadow (made for 1080p screen);
3) No sorting based on distance;
4) Shows elapsed quest time;
5) Shows total damage dealt by player (you).

Note:
I couldn't find total damage dealt by other players. I will keep looking thou.
