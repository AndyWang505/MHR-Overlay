# Monster Hunter Rise Overlay Mod

Built on Monster Hp Bar Mod https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/43?tab=description

But with few differences:

1) Shows health bars for all large monsters;
2) Changed layout, appearance and added text shadow (default values are made for 1080p screen);
3) No sorting based on distance;
4) Shows elapsed quest time;
5) Shows damage dealt by player (you).

# Dependencies:
1) REFramework (https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/26)

# How to install:
1) Install REFramework
2) Download monster_hunter_overlay.lua file
3) Place the file to MonsterHunterRise/autorun folder (if autorun folder is not there, create it).

# Customization:
The beginning of the monster-hunter-rise-overlay.lua file is dedicated to Customization. Open it with any text editor, adjust and change values in Customization Section according to your preference.

To simplify the customization process you can reload scripts in REFramework after each change. No need to restart the game each time. Press Insert Button to open REFramework window inside the game.
REFramework -> ScriptRunner -> Reset Scripts.

# Notes:
1) I couldn't find total damage dealt by other players. I will keep looking thou.
2) Damage meter might work incorrectly due to monster health scaling in multiplayer.
