# Monster Hunter Rise Overlay Mod

Built on Monster Hp Bar Mod https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/43?tab=description

But with few differences:

1) Shows health bars for all large monsters;
2) Changed layout, appearance and added text shadow (default values are made for 1080p screen);
3) No sorting based on distance;
4) Shows elapsed quest time;
5) Shows damage dealt by player (you).

# Dependencies:
1) REFramework (https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/26)

# How to install:
1) Install REFramework
2) Download monster_hunter_overlay.lua file
3) Place the file to MonsterHunterRise/autorun folder (if autorun folder is not there, create it).

# Customization:
Open monster_hunter_overlay.lua file with any text editor and edit values in the beginning of the file according to your preference.

# Notes:
1) I couldn't find total damage dealt by other players. I will keep looking thou.
2) Damage meter might work incorrectly due to monster health scaling in multiplayer.
